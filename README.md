<p> Personal project to learn assembly and get familiar with the Nintendo handheld consoles in particular. </p>
<p> It is a complete game of <i>Pong</i> with singleplayer (Oponent AI is <b>very</b> basic) and multiplayer gamemodes, winning score is 10 points. <br>
The only original feature not implemented is sound. </p>
